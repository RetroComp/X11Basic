Summary     : A Basic Interpreter and compiler with graphics capabilities
Description :

  X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
  capability that integrates features like shell scripting, cgi-Programming and
  full graphical visualisation into the easy to learn basic language on modern
  computers.

  The structure of the language is similar to the ATARI-ST GFA-BASIC.
  GFA-Basic programs should run with only few changes.
 
  On UNIX and linux systems, the X11 graphics engine can be used as well as the
  SDL library, the framebuffer devices or no graphics at all.  The MS WINDOWS
  version supports only SDL (or no graphics at all). 

  This package includes the basic interpreter named xbasic and a set of
  different  compilers. The interpreter can be used as a shell, and can so run
  basic-scripts. You can make excecutable scripts p.ex. *.cgi-Scripts for
  handling web-input. 

  A compiler (xbc) is included which makes stand alone binaries out of the
  scripts, which run more than 10 times faster than the interpreted code. The
  compiler can either pseudo-compile the X11-Basic  sources by attaching the
  source to a run-only interpreter (in which case the  program will not run
  faster than is the interpreter is used, but you have everything in one
  excecutable file), or the compiler can do a real compilation of the BASIC
  source into bytecode, then C, and finally machine language. This way the code
  excecutes  about 10 times faster.

  X11-Basic programs can also be compiled into a bytecode (see xbbc). This
  bytecode  can be interpreted by a virtual machine (see xbvm). Finally, the
  bytecode can be  converted to C sourcefiles (see xb2c) which can be compiled
  with the gnu C compiler (or the tiny C compiler) to native excecutables.

  Ancient ANSI-Basic programs (with line numbers) can be converted to X11-Basic
  with the bas2x11basic program (see the man page bas2x11basic(1) ).

  You will find the compiler sourcecode and some other sample programs in 
  /usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples. A variety of other sample programs 
  can be found in X11-Basic-examples-1.23.zip, which you can download from the 
  homepage (http://x11-basic.sourceforge.net/). Also an up-to-date pdf-version 
  of the manual can be found there.

  Please read the file ./doc/X11-Basic-manual.txt for further information.

  X11BASIC is free software and comes with NO WARRANTY - read the file
  COPYING for details
 
  (Basically that means, free, open source, use and modify as you like, don't
  incorporate it into non-free software, no warranty of any sort, don't blame me
  if it doesn't work.)

Please read the file INSTALL for compiling instructions.

ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
================================

After generating the Makefile, look at the file `options.h' (sparsely
commented) and see if there is anything you want to change.  The only option
that you might need to change is GERMAN, which should be defined if you
like to have a german version of X11-Basic. The default language is english. 

COMPILING a standalone excecutable
==================================

To compile the X11-Basic interpreter (called xbasic), simply type 
	
	make static

at the shell prompt. The produced file is independant of the x11basic 
library and does not need the x11basic framework to be installed.

After X11Basic has been compiled and linked successfully, you can start it
by typing

	./xbasic

The command-line options can be listed with the `-h' option (`./xbasic -h').
INSTALLING the standalone excecutable
=====================================

Put the executable wherever you like. I have mine in ${HOME}/bin/.

A system wide installation can be done with
sudo make install
remove the installation with
sudo make uninstall


make the pseudo-compiler work, libraries:
=========================================

If you want to use the compilers included in this package, you have to
make both the static and dynamic libraries.

cd ./src
make lib              will generate libx11basic.so
make x11basic.a       will generate x11basic.a

-- now you have to be root --

mv libx11basic.so /usr/lib/
mv x11basic.a /usr/lib/
-- please also check the permissions of the files:
chmod 755 	/usr/lib/x11basic.a		
chmod 755       /usr/lib/libx11basic.so 
rehash

make installroot
                  will generate a dynamic linked binary of the interpreter,
		  copy it to /bin/, install the libraries in /usr/local/lib/,
		  install the man-page
-----------------------------
make xbc
                  will make the X11-basic compiler
                  You can then (beeing root) do a 
make xbcinstall
	          to install the compiler in /usr/local/bin/ and the compiler 
		  man-page


After doing all this, you will also find a xbasic.dyn executabe. This is the 
interpreter, dynamically linked and much shorter.

regards and have fun
