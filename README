Summary     : A Basic Interpreter with X11-Graphics capabilities
Description :

X11-Basic implements the most common elements of the basic langugage. With
X11-graphics. The structure of the language is similar to the old ATARI ST
GFA-Basic. GFA-Basic programs should run with only few changes.

This package includes the basic interpreter named xbasic. It can be used as a
shell, can run basic-scripts. You can make excecutable  scripts p.ex.
*.cgi-Scripts for handling web-input. A pseudo compiler is included which
makes stand alone binaries out of the scripts. It compiles itself.

You will find the compiler and many other sample programs in
./doc/packages/X11Basic/examples.

Please read the file ./doc/manual.txt for further information.
