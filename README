Summary     : A Basic Interpreter with X11-Graphics capabilities
Description :

X11-Basic implements the most common elements of the basic langugage. With
X11-graphics. The structure of the language is similar to the old ATARI ST
GFA-Basic. GFA-Basic programs should run with only few changes.

This package includes the basic interpreter named xbasic. It can be used as a
shell, can run basic-scripts. You can make excecutable  scripts p.ex.
*.cgi-Scripts for handling web-input. A pseudo compiler (xbc) is included which
makes stand alone binaries out of the scripts. Also a ANSI-Basic-to-X11-Basic-
converter (bas2x11basic) is now included.

You will find the compiler sourcecode and some other sample programs in 
/usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples. A variety of other sample programs 
can be found in X11-Basic-examples-1.12.zip, which you can download from the 
homepage (http://x11-basic.sourceforge.net/). Also an up-to-date pdf-version 
of the manual can be found there.

Please read the file ./doc/X11-Basic-manual.txt for further information.
