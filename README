Name        : X11Basic

Summary     : A Basic interpreter and compiler with graphics capabilities
Description :

  X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
  capability. 

  The structure of the language is similar to the ATARI-ST GFA-BASIC.
 
  This package includes the basic interpreter named xbasic and a set of
  different compilers.  
  A compiler manager (xbc) is included which makes stand alone binaries out of 
  the BASIC programs, which run more than 10 times faster than the interpreted 
  code. 

  X11-Basic programs can also be compiled into a bytecode (see xbbc). This
  bytecode can be interpreted by a virtual machine (see xbvm). Finally, the
  bytecode can be converted to C sourcefiles (see xb2c) which can be compiled
  with the gnu C compiler (or the tiny C compiler) to native excecutables.

  Ancient ANSI-Basic programs (with line numbers) can be converted to X11-Basic
  with the bas2x11basic program (see the man page bas2x11basic(1) ).

  You will find the compiler sourcecode and some other sample programs in 
  /usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples. However, a much bigger variety of 
  other sample programs can be found in an X11-Basic examples repository on
  gitlab (https://gitlab.com/kollo/X11-Basic_examples/tree/master) or in a
  package X11-Basic-examples-1.25.zip, which you can download from the homepage
  (http://x11-basic.sourceforge.net/). Also an up-to-date pdf-version of the
  manual can be found there.

  Please read the file X11-Basic-manual.txt for further information.

  X11BASIC is free software and comes with NO WARRANTY - read the file
  COPYING for details
 
  (Basically that means, free, open source, use and modify as you like, don't
  incorporate it into non-free software, no warranty of any sort, don't blame me
  if it doesn't work.)

  Please read the file INSTALL for compiling instructions.

  Standard Installation
  =====================

  Starting from the src/ directory you should do a
  ./configure
  make
  
  And for a system wide installation

  sudo make install


  To remove the installation a

  sudo make uninstall

  will do.
  
  For further details of the installation process and different install options
  please read the file INSTALL.


  ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
  ================================

  (only if you have special needs or if the standard installation fails)

  1. Language
  -----------
    
  After generating (with ./configure) the Makefile, look at the file 
  `options.h' (sparsely commented) and see if there is anything you want to 
  change. The only option that you might need to change is GERMAN, which 
  should be defined if you like to have a german version of X11-Basic. 
  The default language is English. 

  2. standalone excecutables (statically linked)
  ----------------------------------------------
  
  a) the interpreter
  
  To compile the X11-Basic interpreter (called xbasic), simply type 
	
	make static

  at the shell prompt. The produced file is independant of the x11basic 
  library and does not need the x11basic framework to be installed.

  After X11Basic has been compiled and linked successfully, you can start it
  by typing

	./xbasic.static

  The command-line options can be listed with the `-h' option (`./xbasic -h').

  INSTALLING the standalone excecutable:
 
  Put the executable wherever you like. I have mine in ${HOME}/bin/.


  b) compiler and libraries

  If you want to use the compilers, you have to make both the static and dynamic
  libraries.

  cd ./src
  make lib              will generate libx11basic.so
  make x11basic.a       will generate x11basic.a

  -- now you have to be root to install the libraries at a place where the 
     compiler can use them --

  mv libx11basic.so /usr/lib/
  mv x11basic.a /usr/lib/
  -- please also check the permissions of the files:
  chmod 755 	/usr/lib/x11basic.a		
  chmod 755       /usr/lib/libx11basic.so 
  rehash

  make xbbc.static xbvm.static xb2c.static xbc
  
  will produce the statically linkd versions of the compilers.

  3. The framebuffer version
  
  It is possible to compile a version of X11-Basic and its libraries, which 
  does not need the X.org framework, but instead uses the systems framebuffer
  and direct mouse device for graphics in and output. This might be useful on
  e.g. the Raspberry Pi or for other handheld devices with low resources.
  
  make clean fb
  
  will produce the framebuffer version of the interpreter called 
  xbasic.framebuffer
  
  4. Crosscompiling for other platforms
     
  a) ATARI ST (with m68k-atari-mint)
     
     make tos

  b) TomTom (with the ARM linux toolchain)
  
     make TomTom

  c) MS WINDOWS (with i586-mingw32msvc-gcc)
  
     make windows
     
  For details you may want to look into the Makefile. Improvements are welcome.


best regards and have fun
