\chapter*{Acknowlegements}

Thanks to all people, who helped me to realize this package.

Many  thanks  to  the developers of GFA-Basic. This basic made me
start programming in the 1980s. Many ideas and most of  the  command 
syntax has been taken from the ATARI ST implementation.

Thanks to sourceforge.net for hosting this project on the web.

Unfortuantely  derivates  of the routines of the famous book 
"numerical recepies in C" are not allowed to be distributed as  part
of  the  X11-Basic program. So I have not included all of the 
mathematics features of X11-Basic in this  distribution.      (see 
\verb|mathemat_dummy.c|).  If you own the book and have a licence 
you may ask me for the sources of the routines.


And here some people, who helped me recently:
in 2012:
 Marcos Cruz (beta testing and bug fixing)
 beos (send me a patch for 64bit version)
