I would like to thak some people, which helped me to realize this package.


I know that there are many problems with the actual compilation of X11-Basic. I
hope I will fix them soon. Now there is a source-distribution available with 
some  Makefiles which I have stolen from Marinos Yannikos (STonX).


Unfortuantely the numerical recepies are not allowed to be distributed. So I had
to remove the FFT-Features from XBasic for this distribution. (see
mathemat_dummy.c).

Please report any errors to m.hoffmann@uni-bonn.de.
