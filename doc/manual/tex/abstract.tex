X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
capability that integrates features like shell scripting, cgi-programming and
full graphical visualization into the easy to learn BASIC language on modern
computers. The syntax is most similar to the old GFA-Basic on ATARI-ST
implementation. Old GFA-programs should run with only few changes.\\[4ex]

{\bf About this document}\\[2ex] This document	describes the features of
X11-Basic. You will find information about the X11-Basic interpreter (the 
program \verb|xbasic| under Unix or \verb|xbasic.exe| under Windows) and the
compiler (the program \verb|xbc| under UNIX or \verb|xbc.exe| under Windows) as
well as the language itself. For a more compact description you may  want to
read the \verb|x11basic(1)| man-page or the man-page of the X11-Basic compiler
\verb|xbc(1)|.
