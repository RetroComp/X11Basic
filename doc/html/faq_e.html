<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Here are some of the most common questions along with answers. This Faq is 
still short, but expected to grow on your input.</p>

<b>Question: </b>Can I use X11-Basic as a shell ?<br> <b>Answer: </b>
Yes, simply copy the xbasic executable to /usr/bin .
The shell scripst then should have in their first line<pre>
#!/bin/xbasic 
</pre>
.
<b>Question: </b>Can I use X11-Basic as an internet daemon ?<br> <b>Answer: </b>
Yes, start xbasic with the option <t>-daemon</t>.
This feature is still experimental. So use it on your own risk since this opens several security holes
to your system.

<p><b>Question: </b>Can X11-Basic generate stand-alone programs, which may run 
without the xbasic executable ?<br> <b>Answer: </b>No. X11-Basic does not 
translate its input into assembly, you always need the xbasic executable. On the other 
hand: the xbasic executable is rather small (&lt;200 kB), so you might spread 
it around with your X11-Basic programs.</p>
<p><b>Question: </b>May I charge for my X11-Basic programs ?<br> <b>Answer:</b> 
Yes, you may. But you should state clearly, that xbasic itself is available 
free of charge. Refer to the <a href="COPYING">copyright</a> 
for details.</p>
