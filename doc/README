 1. ABOUT X11-Basic
 ###################

Copyright information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
X11-Basic is free software and distributed under the GNU License. Read the file
COPYING for details.

Intruduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
X11-Basic is a non-standart Basic interpreter with full X capability and some
other special features. Syntax is most similar to the old GFA-Basic ATARI ST
implementation. Old gfa-prgrams should run with only few changes. 

The actual implementation run on Unix workstations and Linux-PCs with the X
Window system.


Why use an interpreter? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Of course a compiler is often what the programmer wants. But think of  the
advantages of interpreters like shells. In X11-Basic it is even possible to
write self modifying code, which is not with a compiler. One of the main
purposes is to allow software written for Gfa-Basic on Atari ST computer to be
used on other systems. 

What can X11-Basic do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

X11-Basic was initially meant to be a very `low-level' Basic interpreter with
calculation features and a simple graphics interface,  and the possiblility to
use self modifying code. Also many of the system specific library functions
should be accessible. Which it does quite well at the moment. 

For a list of the Commands which are actually implemented please read the file 
x11basic.txt.

 2. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
 #############################

Q: Why can't I compile X11Basic on my Computer with Zintorola 86060 processor and
   Sluggix 0.8 Beta O.S.?
A: If you have GNU-C and X11R5/6 for this system, and X11Basic still won't compile,
   please let me know as soon as possible, I will try to fix it.

Q: How do I leave the interpreter `gently'?
A: type quit or press ctrl-c (twice)

Q: What do all the warnings mean?
A: Well, isn't proper ported to your (any?) system. 

Q: Why do the graphics look funny?
A: Some X-Servers do not clean newly allocated Pixmaps. So rubbish is displayed 
   if the window is maped. Please do a clearw 1 as a first command.

Q: Program XXX doesn't run, what should I do?
A: Well this question is too difficult to answer. 

Q: Where can I get the newest version of X11-Basic? 
A: Probably at ftp.??? or 
   http://cips02.physik.uni-bonn.de/~hoffmann/software.html
   Don't bet on it though! :-) 


Q: What can I do to speed up the development of X11-Basic?
A: You can try to bribe me with any amount of money, any type of hardware or
   software (no pirated stuff please).
   A nice postcard might suffice too. :-)
   If you like to implement some new features and/or commands to x11basic,
   please send me your new sources with description. But I only will implement
   this stuff if I like it .-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3. THE FUTURE
 #############

Things left to do:
- Speed up the interpretation  with precompiled tokens
- Optimize a bit more
- Dynamic linking of elf-object-Files
- Fix the bugs
(etc. etc.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4. HISTORY
 ##########

In the beginning there were absurd plans, long sleepless nights, and incredible
boredom.

Very First Version (1990)
--------------------------
It was a Mailbox-Program with Basic features (only character-Graphics with
Vt100EMU) on my ATARI ST (!).


First version with a version number - Version 0.1    ( 1997)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Mailbox-Program was rewritten in c on my Linux-PC
- first X11-Commands


Version 0.2 Alpha (1998)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- improved X11-Basic for use at the physics institute in Bonn
- Fixed last Problems of the Parser (didn't like -1*(4-3) )
- Added more X-features (redraw)
- First portation to a HP-Workstation
- Readline library in use

Version 1.00 (Mar 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Makefile and configure script adapted from STonX
- True-color Displays
- X rootwindow, multiple windows
- INKEY$
- First GPL-Distribution
- FILESELECT,ALERT

Version 1.01 (Jun 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- POINT()



 5. BUG's
 ########
 
- Integer-Artmetrik sehr(!) unvollstaendig
- EXIT IF         behoben !
- PRINT
- RIGHT$
