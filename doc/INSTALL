INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

In order to compile X11Basic, you will need the following:

 * A C compiler, preferably GNU C (but some ANSI C compilers, like DEC's
  will do)


 * a `csh'-compatible shell 
 
 * X11R5 or R6 libraries

 * the readline library
 
 
These will suffice to get you started (unless I've forgotten something). 


CONFIGURATION
=============

X11Basic uses a "configure" script generated by Cygnus' Autoconf program in order
to determine system-dependent configuration parameters. Invoke the script
by typing

	./configure

or, alternatively, 

	sh configure

if the former doesn't work.

This will generate a `Makefile', link `config.h' to the appropriate file from
the `config' subdirectory and generate dependencies for the Makefile. It will
also generate some more sources.

If the `configure' script fails, please contact me at m.hoffmann@uni-bonn.de 
and send me the output it generated. 


ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
================================

After generating the Makefile, look at the file `options.h' (sparsely
commented) and see if there is anything you want to change.  The only option
that you might need to change is SMALL (check if this is defined in the
`config.h' as well), which should be set to 1 if your system has less than 16MB
physical memory or if linking fails otherwise. 


COMPILING
=========

To compile, simply type 
	
	make

at the shell prompt. 

After X11Basic has been compiled and linked successfully, you can start it
by typing

	./xbasic

The command-line options can be listed with the `-h' option (`./xbasic -h').


INSTALLING
==========

Put the executable wherever you like. I have mine in ${HOME}/bin/.
