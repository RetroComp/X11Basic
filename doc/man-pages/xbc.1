.TH XBC 1 19-Sep-2004 "Version 1.11" "Linux Basic Compiler"
.SH NAME
xbc (X11-Basic compiler) \- X11-Basic pseudo compiler 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xbc
.RI "[ " option " ] " <filename>

.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a comprehensive non-standard Basic interpreter with full X 
capability that integrates fratures like shell scripting, cgi-Programming and 
full graphical visualisation into the easy to learn basic language on moden 
computers.

.IR xbc
can be used to make stand-alone-binaries out of *.bas script-Files.

.B For a desciption of the X11-basic language and Usage of the interpreter see
.I xbasic(1).

.SH Filenames

Xbc process input files
through one or more of three stages: preprocessing, compilation,
and linking.  Source filename suffixes identify the source
language.

Suffixes of source file names indicate the kind of
processing to be done:
.Sp
.nf
.ta \w'\fB.cxx\fP  'u
\&\fB.bas\fP	Basic source; preprocess, compile, link
\&\fB.o\fP	Object file; link
.Sp
.fi
.Sp
Linking is always the last stage unless you use one of the
.BR \-c 
, 
.BR \-b 
or
.BR \-l 
options to avoid it (or unless compilation errors stop the whole
process).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
Precompile the source files, but do not compile nor link.  The compiler
output is a *.c file corresponding to the source file. These *.c files can
be compiled with e.g. the GNU project C Compiler.
.Sp
By default, xbc makes the *.c file name for a source file by replacing
the suffix `\|\c
.B .bas\c
 with
.B .o\c
\&\|'.  Use
.B \-o\c
\& to select another name.
.TP
.B \-c
Precompile and compile the source files, but do not link.  The compiler
output is an object file corresponding to each source file.
.Sp
By default, xbc makes the object file name for a source file by replacing
the suffix `\|\c
.B .bas\c
 with `\|\c
.B .o\c
\&\|'.  Use
.B \-o\c
\& to select another name.
.TP
.B \-l
Precompile and compile the source files, but do not link.  The compiler
output is an object file corresponding to each source file. The source files are compiled 
in a way that they can (and will have to) be linked to other object files. With these
object files it is possible to create a library from your basic routines, which can be 
executed from another program.
.Sp
By default, xbc makes the object file name for a source file by replacing
the suffix `\|\c
.B .bas\c
 with `\|\c
.B .o\c
\&\|'.  Use
.B \-o\c
\& to select another name.
.TP
.BI "\-o " file
Place output in file \c
.I file\c
\&.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output xbc is producing, whether it be an executable file, a *.c file or
an object file.
.Sp
Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to
use `\|\c
.B \-o\c
\&\|' when compiling more than one input file, unless you are
producing an executable file as output.
.Sp
If you do not specify `\|\c
.B \-o\c
\&\|', the default is to put an executable file
in `\|\c
.B b.out\c
\&\|', the object file for `\|\c
.I source\c
.B \&.\c
.I suffix\c
\&\c
\&\|' in
`\|\c
.I source\c
.B \&.o\c
\&\|', and its *.c file in `\|\c
.I source\c
.B \&.c\c
.
.SS \--static
this is the default. The X11-Basic library will be linked to the excecutable.
.SS \--dynamic
The excecutable will be linked dynamically against the X11-Basic library.
.SS \-shared
This option is passed to the linker and tells it, that it should produce a shared
object file which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option. 
Usually the extention should be 
.B .so\c
.
 This option only makes sense
if it was used together with the 
.B -l\c
 option.

.SS \--version
shows version, program and other information and exits
.SS -h --help
print a short help

For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a 
look at the README file. 


.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
xbc testme.bas
    produces an excecutable file b.out
xbc testme.bas -o testme --dynamic
    produces an excecutable file testme
xbc testme.bas -c 
    produces testme.o
xbc testme.bas -b
    produces testme.c
.fi

You can find many sample programs in 
.I /usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples.
.SH The pseudo compiler
Actually this "compiler" is not
a real compiler, since the source code is still interpreted on runtime. But the
source code is linked to the X11-Basic library so there results one 
independant executable. Another advantage is that it is quite hard to extract a
full running *.bas File from this binary since the code is compressd in a way.

.SH BUG REPORTS       

If you find a bug in the X11-Basic pseudo compiler, you should
report it. But first,  you  should make sure that it really is
a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of the
X11-Basic package that you have.

Once  you have determined that a bug actually exists, mail a
bug report to kollo@users.sourceforge.net. If you have a fix,
you  are  welcome  to  mail that as well!  Suggestions  may 
be  mailed  to the x11-basic mailing list on 
www.sourceforge.net/projects/x11-basic  or posted to the bug
tracking system.

Comments and  bug  reports  concerning  this  manual  page
should be directed to kollo@users.sourceforge.net.
