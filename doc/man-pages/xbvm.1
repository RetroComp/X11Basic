.TH XBVM 1 09-Apr-2011 "Version 1.17" "Linux Basic Compiler"
.SH NAME
xbvm (X11-Basic virtual machine) \- X11-Basic bytecode interpreter 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xbvm
.RI "[ " option " ] " <filename>

.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
capability that integrates features like shell scripting, cgi-Programming and 
full graphical visualisation into the easy to learn basic language on modern 
computers.

.IR xbvm
can be used to execute bytecode-binaries which where compiled with 
.I xbbc(1)
 . These bytecode 
files run about 4 to 10 times faster than the interpreted .bas files. 

.B For a desciption of the X11-Basic language and usage of the interpreter see
.I xbasic(1).

.SH Filenames

Xbvm processes one input file. The Suffix of the input file is usually .b.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-q "
Be quiet and print less debug information 
 .
.SS \--version
shows version, program and other information and exits
.SS -h --help
print a short help

For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a 
look at the README file. 


.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
xbvm testme.b
xbbc -q testme.b
.fi

You can find many sample programs in 
.I /usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples.
.SH The virtual machine
Actually this interpreter is a stack machine. The bytecode is very compact 
and similar
to machine code. It would not be a big step to compile it to assembler.  
This interpreter is highly optimized, so that the gain in 
excecution speed is immense. Especially complex formulas are 
speed up by a factor 10.
There is no way to recreate the source code from the bytecode. 

.SH VERSION
Page was created for V.1.14
