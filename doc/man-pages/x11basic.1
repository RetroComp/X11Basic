.SH X11-Basic as daemon:

The commandline option --daemon forces the interpreter to run in daemon-mode.
No prompt is given and the input in not echoed back. 

to run the X11-Basic interpreter on a tcp-socket on port 1371 create a new user 
called xbasic and insert

--- in /etc/inetd.conf: --- 

xbasic stream tcp nowait xbasic /usr/sbin/tcpd /bin/xbasic --daemon

--- in /etc/services: ---

xbasic          1371/tcp

---

Please note that this is not recommended since xbasic would open several 
security holes on your system.

#!/bin/xbasic
