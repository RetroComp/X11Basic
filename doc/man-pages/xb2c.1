.TH XB2C 1 09-Apr-2015 "Version 1.24" "X11-Basic to C Translator"
.SH NAME
xb2c \- X11-Basic to C translator 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xb2c
.RI "[ " option " ] " <filename>

.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming langage with graphics 
capability that integrates fratures like shell scripting, cgi-Programming and 
full graphical visualisation into the easy to learn basic language on modern 
computers.

.IR xb2c
can be used to convert X11-Basic *.b bytecode binary files (produced with 
.I xbbc(1))
into C sourcecode, which can be compiled with the gnu C compiler gcc or any
other ANSI C compiler, e.g. tcc, the tiny c compiler. 
The sources depend on the x11basic.a or libx11basic.so libraries and on the
header file xb2csol.h, which therefore should be installed and linked. The
compiled programs will be faster that the interpreted ones and even a bit
faster that the bytecode processed ones (see 
.I xbbc(1)
 and 
.I xbvm(1)
)
. 

.B For a desciption of the X11-Basic language and usage of the interpreter see
.I xbasic(1).

.SH Filenames

Xb2c processes one input file. The Suffix of the input file is usually .b 
(a bytecode file produced by
.I xbbc(1)
).
The default output file name is 
.I 11.c
but you can specify alternate names with the -o option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-o " file
Place output in file \c
.I file\c
\&. This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output xb2c is producing.
If you do not specify `\|\c
.B \-o\c
\&\|', the default is to put the output into the file `\|\c
.B 11.c\c
\& .
.SS \--version
shows version, program and other information and exits
.SS -h --help
print a short help

For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a look
at the README file and the X11-Basic manual. 


.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
xbbc testme.bas -o testme.b
 produces a bytecode file testme.b
xb2c testme.b -o testme.c
 produces a file testme.c
gcc testme.c -o testme -lx11basic -ldl -lm -lcurses -lncurses -lasound -lreadline -lX11
 produces an excecutable file testme. However the same result can be optained by
xbc -virtualm testme.bas -o testme
 which does all the above steps.
.fi

You can find many sample programs in 
.I /usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples.
.SH The basic to C translator

There is no way to recreate the .bas source code from the c file.. 
But still the c file is platform independant.
