INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

In order to compile X11Basic, you will need the following:

 * A C compiler, preferably GNU C (but some ANSI C compilers, like DEC's
  will do)


 * a `csh'-compatible shell 
 
 * X11R5 or R6 libraries

 * the readline library
 * the curses or ncurses  library
  
These will suffice to get you started. 


INSTALLATION
============
X11Basic uses a "configure" script generated by Cygnus' Autoconf program in
order to determine system-dependent configuration parameters. Invoke the script
by typing

	./configure

or, alternatively, 

	sh configure

if the former doesn't work.

This will generate a `Makefile'
and generate dependencies for the Makefile. It will
also generate some more sources.

Then do the compilation:

make
sudo make install


ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
================================

After generating the Makefile, look at the file `options.h' (sparsely
commented) and see if there is anything you want to change.  The only option
that you might need to change is GERMAN, which should be defined if you
like to have a german version of X11-Basic. The default language is english. 


COMPILING
=========

To compile the X11-Basic interpreter (called xbasic), simply type 
	
	make

at the shell prompt. 

After X11Basic has been compiled and linked successfully, you can start it
by typing

	./xbasic

The command-line options can be listed with the `-h' option (`./xbasic -h').


INSTALLING
==========

Put the executable wherever you like. I have mine in ${HOME}/bin/.


make the pseudo-compiler work, libraries:
=========================================

If you want to use the pseudo compiler included in this package, you have to
make both the static and dynamic libraries.

cd ./src
      If you do not have the file mathematics.c please do
cp mathemat_dummy.c mathematics.c
      then:
make lib              will generate libx11basic.so
make x11basic.a       will generate x11basic.a

-- now you have to be root --

mv libx11basic.so /usr/lib/
mv x11basic.a /usr/lib/
-- please also check the permissions of the files:
chmod 755 	/usr/lib/x11basic.a		
chmod 755       /usr/lib/libx11basic.so 
rehash

make installroot
                  will generate a dynamic linked binary of the interpreter,
		  copy it to /bin/, install the libraries in /usr/local/lib/,
		  install the man-page
-----------------------------
make xbc
                  will make the X11-basic compiler
                  You can then (beeing root) do a 
make xbcinstall
	          to install the compiler in /usr/local/bin/ and the compiler 
		  man-page


After doing all this, you will also find a xbasic.dyn executabe. This is the 
interpreter, dynamically linked and much shorter.

regards and have fun
