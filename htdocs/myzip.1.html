<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>myzip</I>

compresses files using the internal COMPRESS$() function of the X11-Basic 
library.
Compression is
generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the bzip2
compressor.
<P>
An optional encryption can be applied giving a passphrase which can be as long as
up to 16 characters (corresponding to 128 Bit). For details of the encryption 
algorithm see the <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+x11basic">x11basic</A>(1) manual for ENCRYPT$().
<P>
The command-line options are deliberately very similar to 
those of 
<I>GNU gzip, </I>

but they are not identical.
<P>
<I>myzip</I>

expects a list of file names to accompany the
command-line flags.  Each file is replaced by a compressed version of
itself, with the name &quot;original_name.myz&quot;.  
Each compressed file
has the same modification date, permissions, and, when possible,
ownership as the corresponding original, so that these properties can
be correctly restored at decompression time.  File name handling is
naive in the sense that there is no mechanism for preserving original
file names, permissions, ownerships or dates in filesystems which lack
these concepts, or have serious file name length restrictions, such as
MS-DOS.
<P>
<I>myzip</I>

and
<I>myunzip</I>

will by default not overwrite existing
files.  If you want this to happen, specify the -f flag.
<P>
<I>myunzip</I>

decompresses all
specified files.  Files which were not created by 
<I>myzip</I>

will be detected and ignored, and a warning issued.  
<P>
Compression is always performed, even if the compressed 
file is slightly
larger than the original.  Files of less than about one hundred bytes
tend to get larger, since the compression mechanism has a constant
overhead in the region of 50 bytes.  Random data (including the output
of most file compressors) is coded at about 8.1 bits per byte, giving
an expansion of around 1%.
<P>
As a self-check for your protection, 
<I>myzip</I>

uses 32-bit CRCs to
make sure that the decompressed version of a file is identical to the
original.  This guards against corruption of the compressed data, and
against undetected bugs in
<I>myzip</I>

(hopefully very unlikely).  The
chances of data corruption going undetected is microscopic, about one
chance in four billion for each file processed.  Be aware, though, that
the check occurs upon decompression, so it can only tell you that
something is wrong.  It can't help you 
recover the original uncompressed
data.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-o </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Place output in file <I>file</I>. 

If you do not specify `<B>-o</B>', the default is to use
`<B>original_name.myz</B>' (for myzip) and the original name stored in the .myz file (for myunzip)
<DT><B>-f --force</B>

<DD>
Force overwrite of output files.  Normally,
<I>myzip </I>

will not overwrite
existing output files.  Also forces 
<I>myzip </I>

to break hard links
to files, which it otherwise wouldn't do.
<DT><B>-k --keep</B>

<DD>
Keep (don't delete) input files during compression
or decompression.
<DT><B>-q --quiet</B>

<DD>
Suppress non-essential warning messages.  Messages pertaining to
I/O errors and other critical events will not be suppressed.
<DT><B>-v --verbose</B>

<DD>
Verbose mode -- show the compression ratio for each file processed.
Further -v's increase the verbosity level, spewing out lots of
information which is primarily of interest for diagnostic purposes.
<DT></DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>--version</H3>

<DD>
shows version, program and other information and exits
<DL COMPACT>
<DT></DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>-h --help</H3>

<DD>
print a short help
<P>
For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a 
look at the README file.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<PRE>
myzip Example.tar
    produces an output file Example.tar.myz

myunzip Example.tar.myz
    recovers the file Example.tar

<H2>BUG REPORTS </H2>

<P>
If you find a bug in the Lossless file compression and encryption utility, 
you should report it. But first,  you  should make sure that it really is
a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of the
X11-Basic package that you have.
<P>
Once  you have determined that a bug actually exists, mail a
bug report to <A HREF="mailto:kollo@users.sourceforge.net">kollo@users.sourceforge.net</A>. If you have a fix,
you  are  welcome  to  mail that as well!  Suggestions  may 
be  mailed  to the x11-basic mailing list on 
<A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net">www.sourceforge.net</A>/projects/x11-basic  or posted to the bug
tracking system.
<P>
Comments and  bug  reports  concerning  this  manual  page
should be directed to <A HREF="mailto:kollo@users.sourceforge.net">kollo@users.sourceforge.net</A>.
