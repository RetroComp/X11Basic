<h2>X11-BASIC V.1.25</h2>
<img src="3Dxbasic2.png" align=right>

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics and 
sound for personal computers and handheld devices.

<p>
The syntax is most similar to GFA-Basic on the ATARI-ST. It is a
structured dialect with no line numbers. X11-Basic supports big 
integers and big integer arithmetrics.  

<p>

X11-Basic is available for UNIX workstations, Linux, Android, MAC-OSX, as well
as for MS-WINDOWS.  It is also available for the ATARI ST, TomTom car
navigation  systems and the Raspberry Pi.

<p> A BASIC compiler is included so that you can make stand-alone
binaries out of your programs (on all platforms except for Android). 

At least the X11-Basic interpreter is fast and small.

</ul>
<hr>
The interpreter (<tt>xbasic</tt>) can be used as a shell, and can so run
basic-scripts. You can make excecutable scripts p.ex. *.cgi-Scripts for handling
web-input. 
<p>
The compiler (<tt>xbc</tt>) makes stand alone binaries out of the BASIC programs, which 
run much faster than the interpreted code. 
<p>
Where no C compiler is available, X11-Basic programs can be compiled into 
bytecode (see <tt>xbbc</tt>). This bytecode  can be interpreted by a virtual 
machine (see <tt>xbvm</tt>), where it also can be attached to to make a standalone 
excecutable. 
<p>
Ancient ANSI-Basic programs (with line numbers) can be converted to X11-Basic
with the <tt>bas2x11basic</tt> program (see below).
<p>
A variety of example X11-Basic programs can be found in 
<tt>X11-Basic-examples-1.25.zip</tt>, which you can download from the 
download section.
<p>
  X11BASIC is free software and comes with NO WARRANTY - read the file
  COPYING for details
 <p>
(Basically that means, free, open source, use and modify as you like, don't
incorporate it into non-free software, no warranty of any sort, don't blame me
if it doesn't work.)

-- A Program which converts any binary file into X11-Basic sourcecode. This is useful, if you 
want to include Graphics files (pictures, icons, etc..) or any other data, directly into your program. 
This way, you need not load these files on runtime.
