<h2>X11-BASIC V.1.24</h2>
<img src="3Dxbasic2.png" align=right>

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
capability that integrates features like shell scripting, cgi-Programming and 
full graphical visualisation into the easy to learn basic language on modern 
computers.

<p>
The syntax is most similar to the old GFA-Basic ATARI-ST implementation. It is a
structured dialect with no line numbers. X11-Basic supports big 
integers and big integer arithmetrics. You can do any data manipulation and
you may use external functions and libraries. 

<p>
X11-Basic is available for UNIX workstations, Linux, Android, as well as for
MS-WINDOWS.  It is also available for the ATARI ST, TomTom car navigation 
systems and the Raspberry Pi.

<p> A BASIC compiler is included so that you can make stand-alone
binaries out of your programs (on all platforms except for Android). 

At least the X11-Basic interpreter is fast and small.

Summary     : Basic Interpreter with graphics capabilities
Description :

  X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
  capability that integrates features like shell scripting, cgi-Programming and
  full graphical visualisation into the easy to learn basic language on modern
  computers.

  The structure of the language is similar to the ATARI-ST GFA-BASIC.
  GFA-Basic programs should run with only few changes.

This package includes the basic interpreter named xbasic and a set of different 
compilers. The interpreter can be used as a shell, and can so run basic-scripts.
You can make excecutable scripts p.ex. *.cgi-Scripts for handling web-input. 

A compiler (xbc) is included which makes stand alone binaries out of the
scripts, which run much faster than the interpreted code. 

Where no C compiler is available, X11-Basic programs can be compiled into 
bytecode (see xbbc). This bytecode  can be interpreted by a virtual 
machine (see xbvm), where it also can be attached to to make a standalone 
excecutable. 

Ancient ANSI-Basic programs (with line numbers) can be converted to X11-Basic
with the bas2x11basic program (see the man page bas2x11basic(1) ).

A variety of example X11-Basic programs can be found in 
X11-Basic-examples-1.24.zip, which you can download from the download section.

  X11BASIC is free software and comes with NO WARRANTY - read the file
  COPYING for details
 
(Basically that means, free, open source, use and modify as you like, don't
incorporate it into non-free software, no warranty of any sort, don't blame me
if it doesn't work.)
