<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics.
<P>
<B>xbc</B>

can be used to make stand-alone-binaries out of *.bas script files.
<P>

For a desciption of the X11-Basic language and usage of the interpreter see

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Filenames</H2>

<P>
<B>xbc </B>

process input files through one or more of three stages: 
preprocessing, compilation, translation and linking. 
Source filename suffixes identify the source language.
<P>
Suffixes of source file names indicate the kind of
processing to be done:
<PRE>

<B>.bas</B>   Basic source; preprocess, compile, link
<B>.b</B>     bytecode file; translate to C, then compile to native code
<B>.o</B>     Object file; link
</PRE>

<P>
Linking is always the last stage unless you use one of the
<B>-c</B>

, 
<B>-b</B>

or
<B>-l</B>

options to avoid it (or unless compilation errors stop the whole
process).
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b</B>

<DD>
Precompile the source files, but do not compile nor link it. The compiler
output is a *.c file corresponding to the source file. These *.c files can
be compiled with e.g. the GNU project C Compiler.
<P>
By default, xbc makes the *.c file name for a source file by replacing
the suffix `<B>.bas</B><BR>&nbsp;with
<B>.o</B>'. Use
<B>-o</B> to select another name.
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Precompile and compile the source files, but do not link. The compiler
output is an object file corresponding to each source file.
<P>
By default, xbc makes the object file name for a source file by replacing
the suffix `<B>.bas</B><BR>&nbsp;with&nbsp;`<B>.o</B>'. Use
<B>-o</B> to select another name.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
Precompile and compile the source files, but do not link. The compiler output is
an object file corresponding to each source file. The source files are compiled
in a way that they can (and will have to) be linked to other object files. With
these object files it is possible to create a library from your basic routines,
which can be executed from another program.
<P>
By default, xbc makes the object file name for a source file by replacing
the suffix `<B>.bas</B><BR>&nbsp;with&nbsp;`<B>.o</B>'. Use
<B>-o</B> to select another name.
<DT><B>-o </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Place output in file <I>file</I>. This applies regardless to whatever sort of output xbc is producing, 
whether it be an executable file, a *.c file or an object file.
<P>
Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to
use `<B>-o</B>' when compiling more than one input file, unless you are
producing an executable file as output.
<P>
If you do not specify `<B>-o</B>', the default is to put an executable file
in `<B>b.out</B>', the object file for `<I>source</I><B>.</B><I>suffix</I>' in
`<I>source</I><B>.o</B>', and its *.c file in `<I>source</I><B>.c</B><DT><B>-virtualm</B>, <B>--virtualm</B>

<DD>
this option tells the compiler to compile the code to bytecode and then translate it to C 
source and finally compile it with gcc. The code produced is really fast. On UNIX this 
option can always be used unless some compiler trouble occur. 
<DT><B>--static</B>

<DD>
this is the default. The X11-Basic library will be linked to the excecutable.
<DT><B>--dynamic</B>

<DD>
The excecutable will be linked dynamically against the X11-Basic library.
<DT><B>-shared</B>

<DD>
This option is passed to the linker and tells it, that it should produce a shared
object file which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable. Not all systems support this option. 
Usually the extention should be 
<B>.so</B><BR>&nbsp;This&nbsp;option&nbsp;only&nbsp;makes&nbsp;sense
if it was used together with the 
<B>-l</B><BR>&nbsp;option.
<DT><B>-C</B>

<DD>
do not discard comments. All comments are passed through to the
output file.
<DT><B>-s</B>, <B>--strip</B>

<DD>
remove all symbol tables and relocation information from the
executable.
<DT><B>-L</B> <B></B><I>path</I>

<DD>
Use 
<I>path</I>

 when looking for libraries to link (default is /usr/lib). 
<DT><B>--version</B>

<DD>
shows version, program and other information and exits.
<DT><B>-h</B>, <B>--help</B>

<DD>
print a short help and exit.
</DL>
<P>

For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a 
look at the README file.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<PRE>
xbc testme.bas
 produces an excecutable file b.out
xbc testme.bas -o testme --dynamic
 produces an excecutable file testme
xbc testme.bas -c 
 produces testme.o
xbc testme.bas -b
 produces testme.c or 11.c or b.b
xbc testme.bas -virtualm --dynamic -o b.out
 produces b.out, which excecutes really fast!
</PRE>

<P>
You can find additional sample programs in 
<I>/usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples.</I>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>The Compiler Manager</H2>

<P>
Actually xbc is a real compiler, if used with the -virtualm option. However, the
default behaviour is such, that the source code is still interpreted on runtime.
But the source code is linked to the X11-Basic library so there results one 
independant executable. Another advantage is that it is quite hard to extract a
full running *.bas file from this binary since the code is compressd in a way. 
<P>
Why is this the default? Well the compiler can pseudo-compile all BASIC 
programs, which run in the interpreter. The real compiler has some restrictions 
on the BASIC code, because it cannot compile every constructs (e.g. jumps/GOTO
out of a procedure).

<H2>VERSION</H2>

<H2>BUG REPORTS </H2>

<P>
If you find a bug in the X11-Basic compiler xbc, you should report it. But
first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the
latest version of the X11-Basic package that you have.
<P>
Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, mail a bug report to
<A HREF="mailto:kollo@users.sourceforge.net">kollo@users.sourceforge.net</A>. If you have a fix, you are welcome to mail that
as well! Suggestions may be mailed to the bug tracking system.
<P>
Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to
