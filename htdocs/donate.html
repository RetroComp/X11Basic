<h2>X11-BASIC donation page</h2>
X11-Basic is a totally voluntary open source non-profit project. 
Donations in form of money are not necessary. All developpers and contributers
do their work just for fun.
<p>
However, not all work related is really fun and not all resources used are 
really free. Since the official X11-Basic homepage as well as the (official) 
Android app does not include annoying ads, the project is funded exclusively 
by donations (usually the time people donate by debugging and programming).
<p> But of course any other (small) donation is welcome. 
Donations will be used to pay the fees for App-Stores which bring the 
X11-Basic App to your phone, for WEB-hosting, and other expenses necessary 
to keep X11-Basic alife. If more donations will be received than necessary, the
funds will be redonated to other non-profit projects.
<p>

Donations can be made via
